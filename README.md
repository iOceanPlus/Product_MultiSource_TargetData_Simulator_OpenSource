# Product_MultiSource_TargetData_Simulator_OpenSource  

## Introduction  
This project simulates targets in a specified area, several devices are installed in each target. These devices get kinematic information about targets and send to channels. Data sources fetech data from channels periodically.  
Messages are encoded using Google's protobuf, and sent to a rabbitmq server.

Other softwares can fetch data generated by this software from rabbitmq. We have implemented some modules and demos:

Put these datasets with the executable file.

## Environment  
Linux, g++ 4.7 or above is needed.  

## Libs needed  
- libev  

- protobuf：Google's data interchange format  
https://github.com/google/protobuf  

- AMQP-CPP：C++ library for asynchronous non-blocking communication with RabbitMQ  
https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/AMQP-CPP  

- Qt5  
Module: core  positioning 

## How to install libs and run the software  
- Install libs needed  
Download libs needed from http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=1523880373&uk=3506494889   
cd the CentOSLibs directory  
cd each directory under CentOSLibs and run the scripts: ```sudo sh ./DeployLibs.sh ```  
If error occured, modify DeployLibs.sh according to comments in the file.  
Create a directory sqldrivers under the directory that contains the executable file, put the file libqsqlmysql.so into sqldrivers, which is contained in the CentOSLibs directory.  

- Check if the rabbitmq server is runing  
- Download the executable file, param_mq.txt and param.json in the attachments of this project   
- Update the parameters in the param_mq.txt and param.json  
- Grant rights: ``` sudo chmod +rx ./TargetDataSimulator  ```
- check if the software is already runing:```ps -ef |grep Simu```  
- Run the software： ```nohup ./TargetDataSimulator &```  
- check the status  
```top```，see the resource consumed by TargetDataSimulator  
```vi nohup.txt```，inspect the output log
